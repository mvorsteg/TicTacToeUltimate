A Java application I created in the winter of 2018

ttt.jar is a runnable JAR file which will run the game fine,
the .exe file is the same as the jar but with a neat icon

the rest of the files are just the java source files that you can read,
but I did not upload all of the image resource files, which exist already packeaged in the jar and exe files.

have fun with this!
